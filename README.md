SMALL PROJECTS ABOUT FRONT-END

This repository showcases a collection of my small front-end projects, developed to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Each project is designed to solve a specific problem or feature, ranging from simple interactive components to complete web pages.
You'll find examples of dynamic user interfaces, and creative designs, some is styled with Tailwind CSS and SASS for a clean and modern look.
